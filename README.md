# Motivation
- In preparation for the AWS Certified Advanced Networking - Specialty ANS-C01, i want to learn it in a hands-on manner
- I found that it is quite difficult to do so if you need to setup a base setup (some VPCs and EC2 instances) just to verify some ping test, especially you won't want to have all these stuff online which can get expensive
- Cloudformation and Terraform should be the solution to this
- Serve as a chance to learn Terraform as well, go with TF solution
